			<h1>ok but when's world 2 coming out</h1>
			<p>
				We're still hard at work on the beginning-middle of world 2, 
				and while we're not going to give a clear date (because that went great last time..) 
				We can still pretty confidently say that
				<br>
				<b>Wega And The Lost Media World 2 Will Release In 2026 (this year!)</b>
				<br>
				It's nowhere near done, but the wait wont be too long!
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, We recently released a track from W2 on our youtube channel!
				<br>
				<iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OJHiPgmnEuA" class="center"></iframe>
				<br>
				Check it out!

			<h1>please help me</h1>
			<p>
				We're also opening artist and playtester applications! Awesome, right?
				<br> <br> <br>
				<b>PLAYTESTERS</b> 
				<br>
				For playtesters, we have 5 open applications! 
				<br> 
				It's pretty much first come first serve. 
				<br>
				All we ask is the ability to explain, in-depth, your experiences and thoughts with the game, as well as provide us with clear footage, without spoiling the game to the public!
				<br> <br> <br>

				<b>ARTISTS</b>
				<br>
				As for developers, we're looking for around 1-2 artists experienced in digital and pixel art. 
				<br>
				<b>You must be above the age of 15, able to communicate via discord, and willing to join voice calls with other developers (through voice or text).</b>
				<br>
				You'll also need to be prepared to work in a generally casual and unprofessional environment! None of us actually know what we're doing!
				<br> <br> <br>

			<h1>please pay me</h1>
			<p>
				On the topic of development, we recently opened a kofi for the team! <br>
				Donations are entirely optional and not required to play the game, but we would appreciate your support!
				<script type='text/javascript' src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/widget/Widget_2.js'></script>
				<script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Support the team!', '#de29f2', 'F1F31RVINX');kofiwidget2.draw();</script> 
				(i could not figure out how to get that to align to the center my bad guys)

			<h1>copyright infringement and you</h1>
			<p>
				Recently, a notable wega fangame, Wegas challenge: The Idol, was DMCA struck off the Roblox platform.
				<br> 
				To avoid also being DMCAed by The Big N, a few things will have to be changed from now and demo 3. 
				<br>
				<b>There will be no MAJOR changes in gameplay or design.</b> 
				<br>
				Some images of Nintendo characters will be removed/replaced to avoid copyright, and some unoriginal music tracks will be slightly altered. 
				<br>
				While this is a fan game, and has been advertised as such, we would like to see it completed and not DMCAed off the internet!

			<h1>closing</h1>
			<p>
				World 2 is coming along great, and we're really excited to share what we have planned for not only this world, but the entire game! 
				<br>
				It's a huge step up from World 1, and we're certain all of you will enjoy it in some way!
